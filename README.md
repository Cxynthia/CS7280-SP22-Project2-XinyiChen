## introduction

---

Apache Cassandra is an open source NoSQL distributed database used by thousands of companies for scalability and high
availability without compromising performance. Linear scalability and proven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or
cloud infrastructure make it the perfect platform for mission-critical data.

Features of Apache Cassandra includes: hybrid, fault tolerance, focus on quality, performance, user in control, security
and observability, distributed, scalability, and elasticity.

## architecture

---

Apache Cassandra was initially designed at Facebook using a staged event-driven architecture (SEDA) to implement a 
combination of Amazon’s Dynamo distributed storage and replication techniques and Google’s Bigtable data and storage 
engine model. Dynamo and Bigtable were both developed to meet emerging requirements for scalable, reliable and highly 
available storage systems, but each had areas that could be improved.

Cassandra was designed as a best-in-class combination of both systems to meet emerging largescale, both in data 
footprint and query volume, storage requirements. As applications began to require full global replication and always 
available low-latency reads and writes, it became imperative to design a new kind of database model as the relational 
database systems of the time struggled to meet the new requirements of global scale applications.

Cassandra is designed following these design objectives:
- Full multi-master database replication
- Global availability at low latency
- Scaling out on commodity hardware
- Linear throughput increase with each additional processor
- Online load balancing and cluster growth
- Partitioned key-oriented queries
- Flexible schema
